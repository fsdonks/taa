;;How to prep input data:
;;modifications to SupplyDemand
;;Unhide Columns and delete the hidden columns because they include N/As
;;You won't be able to load an Excel workbook that includes N/As
;;Copy and paste everything as values!
;;Search and replce #N/A values to blanks
;;Delete top rows before table headers.
;;Replace newlines in the headers search for Ctrl+J and replace
;;with a blank string.
;;Rename SupplyDemand worksheet in SupplyDemand workbook accordingly.
;;Make Sure OITitle column is called UNTDS
;;Make sure RCAvailable is named as such OR calculate 50% RC Availability
;;(no rounding preferred) or join with variable RC.

;;Delete all worksheets except for SupplyDemand
;;Rename Strength to STR
;;Delete Camp Forward RC for 27-31 per ferguson

;;FORGE Files:
;;Delete all worksheets except SRC_By_Day in FORGE files.
;;merge Airborne IBCT into leg IBCT
;;Make sure all Strength values aren't blank (set to 0 if necessary)

;;Those are all of the steps needed to prep the input data.
